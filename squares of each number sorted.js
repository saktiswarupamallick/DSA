//sort function sort the array in dictionary order ..not ascending   so we have give parameters to that funct
//arr.sort((x,y)=>x-y);//this sort correctly ascend
//-ve x<y(1st arg puts ffirst then 2nd) //+ve x>y (vice versa)
//arr.sort((x,y)=>y-x); //descend
//sort takes lot of instructions



//one of the extreme ends is going to give largest element
//the greater one will fill the sits  from back 
// 2 pointers i and j will come inside accod to which value went to fulfil the space
